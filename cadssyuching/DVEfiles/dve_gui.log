Warning: [DVIT111] 
The design was not compiled with stack debug option.
Stack debugging cannot be supported for Stack and Local Panes.
To enable stack debugging capabilities, please compile the design with option '-debug_access+all'.
Please recompile using the '-debug_access<+options>' switch and incremental options as required.  Recommended options are '-debug_access' for post-process debug, '-debug_access+classdbg' for testbench debug, and '-debug_access+all' for all debug capabilities.  Refer the VCS user guide for more granular options for debug control under the switch '-debug_access' and refer to '-debug_region' for region control.
