Error: [VPD-UTLVF] Unable to lock the VPD file.
  An error occurred while attempt to lock the VPD file. Errno condition: "No 
  such file or directory".
  This error can occur when accessing a vpd file in a different file system 
  like clearcase. Try specifying a vpd file on a local file system or local 
  disk.
*** FATAL: Simulation stopped due to a runtime error (such as null object access) in the HDL code.  Please see above in the log for more details, and/or recompile with '-check_all' to get more information printed to the log.
The simulation cannot be continued. The current simulation state can be observed in DVE/UCLI.
