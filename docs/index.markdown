## Summary

We plan to augment Professor Railing's Computer Architecture Design
Simulator for Students by developing a cycle-accurate network topology
simulator that can simulate how cache coherency messages would propagate
about the network. We plan to use this We will write the network
simulator in SystemVerilog and integrate it into the existing C++
framework by using the SystemVerilog DPI.
