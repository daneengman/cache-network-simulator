        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>We plan to augment Professor Railing's 
          <a href="https://github.com/bprail/cadss_public" target="_blank">CADSS</a> (Computer Architecture Design Simulator for Students)
         by developing a cycle-accurate network topology simulator that can 
        simulate how cache coherrency messages would propogate about the network. We plan
        to use this to simulate how different topologies affect the performance of programs. 
        We will write the network simulator in SystemVerilog and integrate it into the existing
        C++ framework by using the SystemVerilog DPI. </p>
    </section>

    <section id="background">
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>The network topology of a cache interconnect is an important microarchitectual
          feature that will influence performance during various cache transactions, but
          the exact ways that different topologies might affect performance is unclear.
        </p>
          <p>The CADSS is a lightweight architecture simulator that will allow us to easily 
          integrate our network simulator without facing the complexities of a more complex simulator
          like Gem 5. </p>
        <p>
          SystemVerilog is a hardware description and verification language which we will
          use to describe the network. It implicitly supports constructs of timing and and
          parallelism that are not present in software languages, and will allow us to integrate our
          simulation with other tools that can measure power, area and other requirements. 
        </p>

    <section id="challenges">
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>We will need to learn how to use the SystemVerilog DPI to interact
          with the C++ simulator.
        </p>
        <p>We will need to develop and verify network topologies for our simulator.
        </p>

    <section id="resources">
        <h2>Resources</h2>
        <p>As noted before, we will use the CADSS along with SystemVerilog and its 
          DPI.
