## Summary

We plan to augment Professor Railing's Computer Architecture Design
Simulator for Students by developing a cycle-accurate network topology
simulator that can simulate how cache coherency messages would propagate
about the network. We plan to use this We will write the network
simulator in SystemVerilog and integrate it into the existing C++
framework by using the SystemVerilog DPI.

## Up-To-Date Schedule

1.  Week 1: Run basic traces on CADSS and integrate with a very simple
    SystemVerilog network

2.  Week 2: Develop a more complete network in SystemVerilog and test
    its integration with the simulator

3.  Week 3: Develop 3 basic networks and compare performance. Describe
    results for midpoint result.

4.  Week 4: Develop a more advanced network or pairs of networks to
    compare.

5.  Week 5: Finish any other topologies. Perform synthesis analysis on
    power and area. Compare performance and develop final report.
